### For the school summary
- The schools which had the highest percentage of students passing both math and reading are Charter schools even though they had a lower budget per student than the district schools. However they had less student population and that might be a key factor on why they have higher scores. They most likely have lower student to teacher ratios.
- The average math and reading scores for Charter schools was in the 80% range while the average math and reading scores was in the 70% range.
